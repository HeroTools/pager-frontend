# Pager Code of Conduct

The Pager community is made up of contributors, users, and team members from around the world, working together to build better team communication tools. We value diversity and want to create an inclusive, welcoming environment for everyone.

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces, including GitHub repositories, discussions, issues, pull requests, and any other communication channels related to the Pager project.

## Our Standards

### Expected Behavior

We encourage all community members to:

- **Be respectful and inclusive** - Treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or experience level
- **Assume good faith** - Give others the benefit of the doubt and approach disagreements constructively
- **Be collaborative** - Work together to solve problems and build something great
- **Be helpful and supportive** - Assist newcomers and share knowledge generously
- **Use clear, professional communication** - Express yourself clearly and avoid ambiguous language
- **Focus on the project** - Keep discussions relevant to Pager's development and use
- **Give constructive feedback** - Provide actionable, helpful criticism when reviewing code or ideas
- **Take responsibility** - Own your mistakes and learn from them

### Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not tolerated in our community:

- **Harassment or discrimination** of any kind, including but not limited to comments related to race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, nationality, age, disability, or appearance
- **Personal attacks, insults, or inflammatory language** directed at individuals
- **Trolling, spam, or disruptive behavior** that interferes with productive discussion
- **Sharing private information** without explicit permission
- **Threats or intimidation** of any form
- **Inappropriate sexual content or unwelcome sexual attention**
- **Promoting illegal activities or harmful software**
- **Deliberately undermining project goals** or spreading misinformation about the project

## Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to the project maintainers:

- **Email**: conduct@herotools.com
- **Create a private issue**: Contact @zachbresler or other maintainers directly on GitHub

When reporting, please include:

- A description of what happened
- When and where it occurred
- Any relevant links or screenshots
- How the behavior affected you or others

All reports will be handled confidentially and reviewed promptly. We are committed to protecting the privacy of those who report issues.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct. When investigating reports, we may take actions including:

- **Warning** - A private conversation about the unacceptable behavior
- **Temporary suspension** - Limited access to community spaces for a specified period
- **Permanent ban** - Removal from all community spaces and blocking future participation

The response will be proportional to the severity and frequency of the violation. Our goal is education and community health, not punishment.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- All project repositories and their issue trackers, pull requests, and discussions
- Project-related communication on social media, forums, or other platforms
- Project events, meetups, or conferences (virtual or in-person)
- Private communications when they relate to project business or affect community members

## Community Guidelines
