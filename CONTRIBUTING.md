# Contributing to Pager

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Pager! This guide will help you get started with the development workflow and contribution process.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Pager uses a **fork-and-rebase** workflow. All contributors create a fork of the repository and submit pull requests to have their contributions reviewed and accepted. We recommend working on feature branches.

## üìã Before You Start

- Make sure you have Node.js 18.17.0 or later installed
- Familiarize yourself with our [Code Standards](#code-standards)
- Check existing [issues](https://github.com/HeroTools/pager-frontend/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/HeroTools/pager-frontend/pulls)

## üîß Development Setup

### Step 1: Fork and Clone

1. **Fork the repository** by clicking the "Fork" button on [GitHub](https://github.com/HeroTools/pager-frontend)

2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone --config pull.rebase=true https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pager-frontend.git
   cd pager-frontend
   ```

   The `--config pull.rebase=true` configures Git to use rebase by default, which keeps a cleaner history.

3. **Set up the upstream remote** to sync with the main repository:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/HeroTools/pager-frontend.git
   ```

4. **Verify your remotes**:

   ```bash
   git remote -v
   # Should show:
   # origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pager-frontend.git (fetch)
   # origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pager-frontend.git (push)
   # upstream  https://github.com/HeroTools/pager-frontend.git (fetch)
   # upstream  https://github.com/HeroTools/pager-frontend.git (push)
   ```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Environment Setup

1. **Copy the environment template**:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Fill in your environment variables** in the `.env` file:
   - Supabase credentials
   - OpenAI API key
   - Any other required configuration

### Step 4: Start Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application running.

## üåä Git Workflow

### Keeping Your Fork Updated

Before starting work on a new feature, always sync your fork:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git rebase upstream/main
git push origin main
```

### Working on Features

1. **Create a feature branch** from the latest main:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our [Code Standards](#code-standards)

3. **Test your changes**:

   ```bash
   npm run check-all
   ```

4. **Commit with clear messages**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description of what you did"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** from your fork to the main repository

### Handling Merge Conflicts

If your branch conflicts with upstream changes:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
# Resolve any conflicts in your editor
git add .
git rebase --continue
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## üéØ Code Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Prefer strict type checking
- Use proper type definitions instead of `any`

### Code Style

- Use the existing ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Run `npm run format` before committing
- Follow existing naming conventions:
  - `camelCase` for variables and functions
  - `PascalCase` for components and types
  - `kebab-case` for file names

### Component Structure

```typescript
// Good component structure
interface ComponentProps {
  title: string
  onAction: () => void
}

export function Component({ title, onAction }: ComponentProps) {
  return (
    <div className="component-container">
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <button onClick={onAction}>Action</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages:

```bash
# Good
git commit -m "Add message threading support"
git commit -m "Fix typing indicator not showing"
git commit -m "Refactor channel creation modal"

# Bad
git commit -m "updates"
git commit -m "fix bug"
git commit -m "changes to chat"
```

## üß™ Quality Checks

### Before Submitting

Run the full quality check suite to ensure your changes meet our standards:

```bash
npm run check-all
```

This runs:

- ESLint for code quality
- TypeScript type checking
- Prettier formatting check

### Quick Fixes

If you need to fix linting and formatting issues quickly:

```bash
npm run fix-all
```

### Troubleshooting Build Issues

If you encounter build problems, try clearing the cache:

```bash
npm run clean
npm install
npm run dev
```
